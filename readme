After this, I tried to code a function to get corners of the edeges in a rotated rectangle.
Bascially, just read this thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41898990/find-corners-of-a-rotated-rectangle-given-its-center-point-and-rotation

And read the getCorners() function, 

After i finally finished the getCorners function, I tried doing the projections.

To fully understand Vector Projections I had to watch this

After that, I learnt to get the normal axes (It was ez for rectangles)
